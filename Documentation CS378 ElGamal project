Documentation CS378 ElGamal project	
author: Shui Ki Cheung 

purpose: trying to execute Elgamal encryption over a small amout of text and decrypt to prove the program work. 
This program make use of the GMP library 
this program will find n bit prime and primitive root of the prime. 
generate public key and private key for encryption and decryption 
Then use ElGamal method to encrypt and decrpty the message

for each character, there can be a representation of an integer less than 256
so the program will read each character into a string of character 
then will read all the character into integer value and store in the z which is a very large integer

main function in the program 

modularexpon
input a, k, m it will set the l to be the value of a^k mod m
it use memory efficient method so it is quick  

primenoandroot
take in the input of no. of n bit and t as the desired confidence 
it make use of the library function from GMP 
it will random generate a n bit no. 
then it will find the next prime by using function from GMP 
after finding the prime 
the primitive root g 
will make use of the g^p-1 = 1 mod p 
it will test the g using the mpz_powm_sec from GMP 

publicandprivatekey

using the random function from gmp  and generate x less than p and compute h 
then output the k1 key and k2 key to k1.txt and k2.txt

encoding
encoding the message from message.txt with 
z0 = m0 + m1x + m2x^2 +.... m24x^24

where x = 2^8 = 256

for testing purpose i have set the k = 25 so k-1 = 24


encryption 
using the key from k1 and compute ci and di to get the cipher
the cipher will output as cipher text

decryption 
using the key from k2 and compute zi
still working on it , having trouble decoding the zi
and for some reason, the z is not equal to the z from encoding 
trying to figure out what's wrong in the progress
